🤖 Auto Face Tracker Project 🎯

This project implements a real-time face tracking system that combines computer vision (🧠 OpenCV) with Arduino-controlled stepper motors (⚙️) to automatically follow a detected face.

🧩 Project Phases

Phase 1: 🕵️‍♂️ Detects and tracks faces using a webcam with OpenCV.

Phase 2: 🔄 Uses the detected face position to control a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor via Arduino, allowing the camera to auto-follow the face.

💻 Technologies Used

🐍 Python (OpenCV, NumPy)

🔌 Arduino (Stepper Motor Control)

🚀 Key Features

⚡ Real-time face detection and tracking

🎥 Dynamic camera movement based on face position

🔄 Smooth stepper motor motion

💬 Serial communication between Python and Arduino

📂 Repository Includes

🧾 Python script for face detection and tracking

⚙️ Arduino .ino code for motor control

🧩 Configuration files & screenshots

💡 Phase 1 focuses on webcam-based tracking, while Phase 2 integrates hardware for automated motion.
📸 Watch your camera follow your face — just like magic! ✨
